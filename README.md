# LSTM-Stock-trend-prediction
LSTM classifier to predict next day close price trend prediction compare to previous trading day close price
Steps to execute the project
STEP#1:
        create a folder models in the same directory of dj15.ipynb.
        First run dj15.ipynb, it generates afterDJIA.csv file.
        This code will create LSTM classifier and trained it using training data.
	It will test classifir on test data and test out will be store in csv file afterDJIA.csv.

STEPS#2: Execute DTF.ipynb, it a code for trading strategy using LSTM as classifier
